# NdT3 Discord Bot

This is my first Discord bot made using [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js).

# It currently has these features:
  - Kicking users
  - Banning users
  - Ping command
  - Eval command
  - Purge
  - Say command (says what you tell it to say)
  - Stats
  - Stopping the bot using a command
  - Testing command (Testing, testing, 1 2 3)
  - Change settings command
  - Embed command (basic, using RichEmbed)
  - Deleted message logs

# Planned features!

  - ~~Music commands~~ I have decided to completely remove the `play` command and remove all future plans for music features

### Installation
First of all, clone this repository.

This bot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v8+ (and npm) to run.

Also, please make a channel for mod logs in your Discord server.

Once you have that done, edit the `config.json.example` file and then rename the file to `config.json`.
After that, you can install the dependencies and start the bot

**You can use the command line**
```sh
$ cd DiscordBot
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
**OR** start the bot using the `linux_run.sh` for Linux or `windows_run.bat` for Windows.

>This bot must be run on a Discord bot account. Do __NOT__ try to run this on a normal user account. This is against the Discord Terms of Service.

>>Also, do __NOT__ play with the `eval` command. As this bot is made with Node.js, it has access to your entire hard drive. You have been warned
